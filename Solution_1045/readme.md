## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Grouping and Subquery

We can group the `Customer` table by `customer_id`, and then use the `HAVING` clause to filter out the customers who have not purchased all products. To do this, we can use a subquery to find the total number of distinct products, and then compare it with the number of distinct products purchased by each customer.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM Product);
```
